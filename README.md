# gscrape
A webscraper for Gogoanime.gs



# About:
Gscrape scrapes the home page of gogoanime.gs, returning the title and episode numbers. It also allows you to open the link to the anime in your default browser.

# Installation/Usage:

Clone this repo
Run gscrape.py using python

The scraper uses BeautifulSoup and lxml, which can both be installed using pip.

# Note:
There are much better alternatives out there, like pystardust's ani-cli, but this wasn't made to be good. I'm inexperienced to programming, so I would appreciate any constructive criticism
