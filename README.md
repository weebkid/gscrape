# gscrape
A webscraper for gogoanime.gs



# About:
gscrape scrapes the home page of gogoanime.gs, returning the title and episode numbers. It also allows you to open the link to the anime in your default browser.

# Installation/Usage:

Clone this repo
Run gscrape.py

The scraper uses BeautifulSoup and lxml, which can both be installed using pip.

# Note:
There are much better projects out there, like pystardust's ani-cli. This is just a full python alternative. Expect development to be slow because I'm a secondary school student.

Update: I will no longer update this, however, note that you definitely should be able to revive this by simply changing the url!
